# Group 1: Project 1

### Calculating the Host Advantage
- Use top 10 other countries for comparison vs. the host country
- Calculate mean of medal count
- Calculate total medal rate
- Compare Host Year calculations vs. global means
- Where did country place in the medal standings for their hosted olympics vs. other olympics
- z-scores for Olympiad (how many standard deviations away from the mean)

### Prolems to explore:
- Each athlete of a particular team is being counted as an individual medal towards medal count

### To-Do
- Pretty charts: use gold, silver, bronze for the medal count bar graphs
- z-scores for rest of world table

### China file for the sake of reference

It seems running the files locally causes divergence in our repo. It's probably easier to just reference this CoLab notebook.
